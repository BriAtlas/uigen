# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the UIGen codebase has identified **1 Critical**, **3 High**, **4 Medium**, and **3 Low** severity vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The most serious issue is the **exposure of a production API key in the committed `.env` file**, which poses an immediate financial and operational risk.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Immediate action required to prevent unauthorized API usage and potential data breaches.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### Exposed API Key in Version Control
- **Location**: `.env` (line 3)
- **Description**: A production Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api03-[REDACTED]`) is hardcoded and committed to version control. This is a critical security violation that exposes the API key to anyone with repository access.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized API usage leading to unexpected charges, potential rate limiting, service disruption, and compromise of AI-generated content
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** revoke the exposed API key from the Anthropic console
  - [ ] Generate a new API key and store it securely outside version control
  - [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if not already present
  - [ ] Remove the API key from git history: `git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all`
  - [ ] Use environment variable injection in production deployments
  - [ ] Implement API key rotation policy
  - [ ] Review git commit history for any other exposed secrets

## High Vulnerabilities

### JWT Secret Exposure
- **Location**: `.env` (line 6)
- **Description**: JWT secret key is committed to version control and appears to be a development secret rather than a cryptographically secure production secret
- **Impact**: Session hijacking, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to user accounts
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Immediately generate a new cryptographically secure JWT secret: `openssl rand -base64 64`
  - [ ] Remove the current secret from git history
  - [ ] Store JWT secret as an environment variable in production
  - [ ] Implement JWT secret rotation mechanism
  - [ ] Ensure secret is at least 64 characters long in production
  - [ ] Review all existing sessions and consider forced logout

### Insufficient Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Location**: `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` (lines 85-95, 162-175)
- **Description**: Rate limiting falls back to in-memory storage which is not persistent across server restarts and can be bypassed. Additionally, rate limiting can be completely disabled in development
- **Impact**: Denial of Service attacks, API abuse, resource exhaustion
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement Redis or persistent storage for rate limiting
  - [ ] Remove development bypass option or restrict to localhost only
  - [ ] Add distributed rate limiting for multi-instance deployments
  - [ ] Implement progressive delays and temporary IP blocking
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to all API endpoints, not just protected ones
  - [ ] Monitor and alert on rate limit violations
- **References**: [OWASP Rate Limiting Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#rate-limiting)

### Weak Password Validation in Sign-In
- **Location**: `src/actions/index.ts` (lines 122-125)
- **Description**: Sign-in endpoint only validates password length > 1, bypassing the strong password requirements used in sign-up
- **Impact**: Weak passwords can be used to access accounts if compromised, inconsistent security policy
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Apply same password validation rules to sign-in as sign-up
  - [ ] Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  - [ ] Add CAPTCHA after repeated failed login attempts
  - [ ] Log and monitor failed authentication attempts
  - [ ] Implement proper session invalidation on password change

## Medium Vulnerabilities

### Insufficient Input Sanitization
- **Location**: `src/lib/validation.ts` (lines 71-78)
- **Description**: The `sanitizeInput` function only handles basic HTML entities but doesn't protect against all XSS vectors or injection attacks
- **Impact**: Cross-site scripting (XSS), potential code injection in specific contexts
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Use a robust sanitization library like DOMPurify
  - [ ] Implement context-aware output encoding
  - [ ] Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs at API boundaries
  - [ ] Use parameterized queries for database operations
- **References**: [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### Missing API Input Validation
- **Location**: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 12-30)
- **Description**: The chat API endpoint doesn't validate the structure and content of incoming messages, files, or projectId parameters
- **Impact**: Malformed data processing, potential injection attacks, application crashes
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation schema using Zod or similar
  - [ ] Validate message content for XSS and injection patterns
  - [ ] Sanitize file paths and content before processing
  - [ ] Limit message size and file count per request
  - [ ] Validate projectId format and ownership
  - [ ] Add request size limits and timeout controls
- **References**: [OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### Insecure Cookie Configuration
- **Location**: `src/lib/auth.ts` (lines 73-85, 92-104)
- **Description**: Cookies are only secured in production, leaving development environments vulnerable. Refresh token has restricted path but access token doesn't
- **Impact**: Session hijacking in development, potential token exposure through XSS
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Always use secure cookies, even in development with HTTPS
  - [ ] Add `__Secure-` prefix to cookie names in production
  - [ ] Implement SameSite=Strict for all authentication cookies
  - [ ] Add path restrictions to access tokens
  - [ ] Implement cookie integrity checks
  - [ ] Set appropriate Domain attribute for cookies
- **References**: [OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### Information Disclosure in Error Messages
- **Location**: Multiple files (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`, `src/actions/index.ts`, etc.)
- **Description**: Detailed error messages and console.error calls may expose sensitive information in logs and responses
- **Impact**: Information leakage that could aid attackers in reconnaissance
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement generic error messages for production
  - [ ] Remove or sanitize console.error statements in production builds
  - [ ] Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels
  - [ ] Ensure database errors don't expose schema information
  - [ ] Create custom error handlers that log details securely
- **References**: [OWASP Error Handling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html)

## Low Vulnerabilities

### Missing Security Headers
- **Location**: `src/middleware.ts` (lines 19-22)
- **Description**: While some security headers are implemented for API routes, additional security headers are missing such as Strict-Transport-Security, Referrer-Policy, and Content-Security-Policy
- **Impact**: Reduced defense against various client-side attacks
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Add Strict-Transport-Security header for HTTPS enforcement
  - [ ] Implement Content-Security-Policy to prevent XSS
  - [ ] Add Referrer-Policy header to control referrer information
  - [ ] Include Permissions-Policy for feature restrictions
  - [ ] Add these headers to all responses, not just API routes
- **References**: [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/)

### Insufficient Session Timeout
- **Location**: `src/lib/auth.ts` (lines 52-56)
- **Description**: Access tokens have a 1-hour lifetime and refresh tokens have 7-day lifetime, which may be too long for sensitive applications
- **Impact**: Extended window for session hijacking if tokens are compromised
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Consider reducing access token lifetime to 15-30 minutes
  - [ ] Implement sliding session expiration
  - [ ] Add user activity tracking for automatic logout
  - [ ] Implement "remember me" functionality as optional
  - [ ] Allow users to view and revoke active sessions
- **References**: [OWASP Session Timeout Guidance](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-expiration)

### Development Environment Security Bypass
- **Location**: `src/lib/auth.ts` (lines 11-19), `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` (lines 85-95)
- **Description**: Multiple security controls are disabled or weakened in development mode, creating inconsistency between environments
- **Impact**: Security issues may not be detected during development and testing
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Maintain security controls in development environments
  - [ ] Use feature flags instead of environment-based bypasses
  - [ ] Implement separate configuration for local development only
  - [ ] Ensure staging environment mirrors production security
  - [ ] Document all security differences between environments
- **References**: [OWASP DevSecOps Best Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/)
