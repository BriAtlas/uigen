# Security Audit Report - UIGen
**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Assessment AI  
**Scope**: Complete codebase security review

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the UIGen codebase identified **1 CRITICAL** and several high-to-medium priority security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The most critical finding is **exposed API keys in the committed `.env` file**, which poses a significant security risk. While the application demonstrates good security practices in many areas (authentication, input validation, CORS configuration), the exposed secrets create substantial risk that needs immediate remediation.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Due to exposed production secrets
**Immediate Action Required**: Rotate all exposed API keys and implement proper secrets management

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Exposed API Keys in Version Control
- **Location**: `D:\pyprj\uigen\.env` (line 3)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: The `.env` file contains a real Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api03-[REDACTED]`) that is committed to version control
- **Impact**: Complete compromise of API access, potential unauthorized AI model usage, billing fraud, and data exposure
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** rotate the exposed Anthropic API key in your Anthropic dashboard
  - [ ] Remove the `.env` file from version control: `git rm --cached .env`
  - [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already present - verify it's working)
  - [ ] Update deployment scripts to use environment variable injection
  - [ ] Audit all commits for other potential secret exposures: `git log --all -p | grep -i "api.*key\|secret\|password"`
  - [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets (e.g., detect-secrets, git-secrets)

## High Vulnerabilities

### 2. Database File Exposed in Repository
- **Location**: `D:\pyprj\uigen\prisma\dev.db`
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Description**: SQLite database file containing user data, passwords, and audit logs is accessible
- **Impact**: Exposure of user credentials (hashed passwords), email addresses, project data, and audit trails
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Add `*.db` to `.gitignore` to prevent future database commits
  - [ ] Remove existing database from version control: `git rm --cached prisma/dev.db`
  - [ ] Verify production databases are not committed anywhere
  - [ ] Implement database backup strategies that don't involve version control
  - [ ] Consider using environment-specific database configurations

### 3. Insufficient Rate Limiting Configuration  
- **Location**: `D:\pyprj\uigen\src\lib\rate-limit.ts`
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Description**: Rate limiting is bypassed in development mode and may have insufficient limits for production
- **Impact**: Potential for API abuse, resource exhaustion, and denial of service attacks
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Review and tighten rate limiting thresholds for production
  - [ ] Implement different rate limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users
  - [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for rate limit violations
  - [ ] Consider implementing progressive delays for repeated violations
  - [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting in addition to user-based limits

## Medium Vulnerabilities

### 4. Weak JWT Secret Validation
- **Location**: `D:\pyprj\uigen\src\lib\auth.ts` (lines 25-26)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: JWT secret validation requires only 32 characters, which may be insufficient for production security
- **Impact**: Potential JWT token forgery if secret is compromised or weak
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Increase minimum JWT secret length to 64 characters for production
  - [ ] Implement entropy checking for JWT secrets
  - [ ] Add JWT secret rotation capabilities
  - [ ] Use cryptographically secure random generation for JWT secrets
  - [ ] Consider using asymmetric keys (RS256) instead of symmetric (HS256)

### 5. Missing Security Headers
- **Location**: `D:\pyprj\uigen\next.config.ts`
- **Severity**: MEDIUM  
- **Description**: Next.js configuration lacks comprehensive security headers
- **Impact**: Vulnerability to clickjacking, content sniffing attacks, and other client-side attacks
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - [ ] Implement Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS enforcement
  - [ ] Add Referrer-Policy headers
  - [ ] Configure X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies
  - [ ] Implement Feature-Policy/Permissions-Policy headers
- **Code Example**:
```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  devIndicators: false,
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/(.*)',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
            value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
          },
          {
            key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
            value: 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
          },
          {
            key: 'Referrer-Policy',
            value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
          }
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

### 6. Potential Code Injection in JSX Transformer
- **Location**: `D:\pyprj\uigen\src\lib\transform\jsx-transformer.ts`
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Dynamic code transformation using Babel could potentially execute malicious code
- **Impact**: Code injection, XSS, or arbitrary code execution if malicious JSX is processed
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement strict JSX parsing and validation before transformation
  - [ ] Add allowlist of permitted React components and imports
  - [ ] Sanitize all user-provided JSX before processing

## Low Vulnerabilities

### 7. Verbose Error Messages in Development
- **Location**: Multiple files using `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Description**: Development mode exposes detailed error information that could aid attackers
- **Impact**: Information disclosure that could help in reconnaissance attacks
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Ensure production deployments never use development mode
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose internal details
  - [ ] Add monitoring for accidental development mode deployments
  - [ ] Review all error messages for sensitive information exposure

### 8. Missing Input Length Limits
- **Location**: Various form inputs throughout the application
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Description**: Some inputs may lack proper length restrictions
- **Impact**: Potential for buffer overflow attacks or resource exhaustion
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement consistent input length limits across all forms
  - [ ] Add server-side validation for all input lengths
  - [ ] Implement proper truncation handling for long inputs
